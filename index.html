              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Corazon C. Aquino (1986–1992)</h4>
              <p class="description">Corazon Aquino immediately formed a revolutionary government to normalize the situation, and provided for a transitional "Freedom Constitution".A new permanent constitution was ratified and enacted in February 1987.The constitution crippled presidential power to declare martial law, proposed the creation of autonomous regions in the Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao, and restored the presidential form of government and the bicameral Congress.Progress was made in revitalizing democratic institutions and respect for civil liberties, but Aquino's administration was also viewed as weak and fractious, and a return to full political stability and economic development was hampered by several attempted coups staged by disaffected members of the Philippine military.

Economic growth was additionally hampered by a series of natural disasters, including the 1991 eruption ofMount Pinatubo that left 700 dead and 200,000 homeless.During the Aquino presidency, Manila witnessed six unsuccessful coup attempts, the most serious occurring in December 1989.

In 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected a treaty that would have allowed a 10-year extension of the U.S. military bases in the country. The United States turned over Clark Air Base in Pampanga to the government in November, and Subic Bay Naval Base in Zambales in December 1992, ending almost a century of U.S. military presence in the Philippines.</p>

              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Fidel V. Ramos (1992–1998)</h4>
              <p class="description">In the 1992 elections, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, endorsed by Aquino, won the presidency with just 23.6% of the vote in a field of seven candidates. Early in his administration, Ramos declared "national reconciliation" his highest priority and worked at building a coalition to overcome the divisiveness of the Aquino years. He legalized the Communist Party and laid the groundwork for talks with communist insurgents, Muslim separatists, and military rebels, attempting to convince them to cease their armed activities against the government. In June 1994, Ramos signed into law a general conditional amnesty covering all rebel groups, and Philippine military and police personnel accused of crimes committed while fighting the insurgents. In October 1995, the government signed an agreement bringing the military insurgency to an end. A peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a major separatist group fighting for an independent homeland in Mindanao, was signed in 1996, ending the 24-year old struggle. However, an MNLF splinter group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front continued the armed struggle for an Islamic state. Efforts by Ramos supporters to gain passage of an amendment that would allow him to run for a second term were met with large-scale protests, leading Ramos to declare he would not seek re-election.</p>

              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Joseph Estrada (1998–2001))</h4>
              <p class="description">Joseph Estrada, a former movie actor who had served as Ramos' vice president, was elected president by a landslide victory in 1998. His election campaign pledged to help the poor and develop the country's agricultural sector. He enjoyed widespread popularity, particularly among the poor. Estrada assumed office amid the Asian Financial Crisis. The economy did, however, recover from a low −0.6% growth in 1998 to a moderate growth of 3.4% by 1999. Like his predecessor there was a similar attempt to change the 1987 constitution. The process is termed as CONCORD or Constitutional Correction for Development. Unlike Charter change under Ramos and Arroyo the CONCORD proposal, according to its proponents, would only amend the 'restrictive' economic provisions of the constitution that is considered as impeding the entry of more foreign investments in the Philippines. However it was not successful in amending the constitution.

On March 21, 2000 President Estrada declared an "all-out-war" against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front(MILF) after the worsening secessionist movement in Midanao. The government later captured 46 MILF camps including the MILF's headquarters', Camp Abubakar. In October 2000, however, Estrada was accused of having accepted millions of pesos in payoffs from illegal gambling businesses. He was impeached by the House of Representatives, but his impeachment trial in the Senate broke down when the senate voted to block examination of the president's bank records. In response, massive street protestserupted demanding Estrada's resignation. Faced with street protests, cabinet resignations, and a withdrawal of support from the armed forces, Estrada was forced from office on January 20, 2001.</p>

              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001–2010)</h4>
              <p class="description">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (the daughter of President Diosdado Macapagal) was sworn in as Estrada&#39;s successor on the day of his departure. Her accession to power was further legitimized by the mid-term congressional and local elections held four months later, when her coalition won an overwhelming victory. Arroyo&#39;s initial term in office was marked by fractious coalition politics as well as a military mutiny in Manila in July 2003 that led her to declare a month-long nationwide state of rebellion. Arroyo had declared in December 2002 that she would not run in the May 2004 presidential election, but she reversed herself in October 2003 and decided to join the race She was re-elected and sworn in for her own six-year term as president on June 30, 2004. In 2005, a tape of a wiretapped conversation surfaced bearing the voice of Arroyo apparently asking an election official if her margin of victory could be maintained. The tape sparked protests calling for 
                  Arroyo&#39;s resignation. Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to an election official, but denied allegations of fraud and refused to step down. Attempts to impeach the president failed later that year. Arroyo unsuccessfully attempted a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present presidential-bicameral republic into a federal parliamentary-unicameral form of government.

The Maguindanao massacre took place in the dawn of her administration, where 58 where killed, many were journalists.</p>

              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Benigno Aquino III (2010-2016)</h4>
              <p class="description">Benigno Aquino III began his presidency on June 30, 2010, the fifteenth President of the Philippines. He is a bachelor and the son of former Philippines president Corazon C. Aquino. His administrations focused on major reforms that would bring greater transparency, reduced poverty, reduced corruption, and a booming market which will give birth to a newly industrialized nation. Tensions regarding Sabah due to theSultanate of Sulu's claim, and tensions with China due to the South China Sea rose in his administration. Standoffs in Sabah between The Sultanate of Sulu's Royal Army and the Malaysian forces struck in 2013. The Philippines also clashed with China on a standoff in Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, which thePhilippines call the West Philippine Sea. This resulted in the proceedings of the Philippines to file a sovereignty case against China in an internation arbitration tribunal.on 2012 the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed to create the Bangsamoro Government in Mindanao.On 2013 the Zamboanga Citywas attacked by a faction of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) under Prof.Nur Misuari.
The Sultanate of Panay, born in 2011, was recognized by the Lanao Advisory Council in 2012. The country became one of the fastest growing economies in his administration, which is expected to be the biggest economy in ASEAN by 2015. The Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) was assembled which aims to create an independent Moro nation from the Philippines through armed struggle. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)struck the Central Philippines in 2013 which created massive help from the international community.

In 2014, the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro was finally signed after 17 years of negotiation with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a move that is expected to bring peace in Mindanao and theSulu. Communist insurgency started to wane due to the government's improving security. His government then filed a memorial to the Arbitration Tribunal in The Hague which challenged Beijing's claim in the South China Sea after Chinese ships harassed a small Philippine vessel carrying goods for stationed military personnel in the South Thomas Shoal where an old Philippine ship has been stationed for years.

On April 28, 2014, when US President Barack Obama visited the Philippines, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), between the United States of America and the Philippines, was signed.

On July 27, 2014, the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) celebrates its 100 years in the Philippines, a big celebration was held in the largest indoor arena in the world, the Philippine Arena with an attendance of more than 2 million members.</p>

              <h4 class="title" style="color: #0099FF">Administration of Roddrigo Roa Duterte (2016-present)</h4>
              <p class="description">The first tax reform law (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion or TRAIN law) was signed in December 2017, Duterte’s 2nd year in office. It’s primarily a revenue-generating measure to fund the administration’s infrastructure program, health, education, and social services programs. But it also allowed Filipinos to keep more of their salary while imposing higher taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks, cigarettes, cars, and fuel – a burden on poor Filipinos. The government is trying to ease that burden with cash assistance. Duterte wants Congress to pass a second tax reform law. The signing then ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law is a major achievement for both the Mindanaoan President and Congress.

It built on the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro, signed during the Aquino administration. Duterte has appointed officials to lead the new Bangsamoro government and continues to be involved in shepherding the region. Beginning with a campaign promise to give the poorest Filipinos access to hospitals and medicines, Duterte ended up pushing for and signing the Universal Health Care law, with the help of Congress. Now it’s a major measure that was often used in the 2016 campaign as brownie points for voters. Although it was never a campaign promise, Duterte pushed for the enactment of the free tertiary education law, against the advice of his economic managers. The government’s fiscalizers now face the challenge of finding funding for this expensive law every year but it’s a welcome development for Filipino families everywhere.These are just some accomplishements of our current presidents and we were'e know what he can do more for our country.</p>
